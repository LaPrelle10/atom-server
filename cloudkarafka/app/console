# Cloudkarafka App : 
# Config. Vars : 

 Setting up for this server option if you dont have one already is going to require that you going to either - 
https://www.heroku.com/ or https://www.cloudkarafka.com/ and signing up an account if you do this you'll receive a server list, apikey, username, password
and a region you'll have to pick one as well either by going to https://awsconsole.com/ or https://googlecloudconsole.com/ and creating an account for better access 
and more options. Personally I recommend this being a strong choice that you consider taking.
